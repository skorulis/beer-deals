I need to start by rebuilding the add venue thing

PK is always placeID
SK is either PLACE#placeID
or DEAL#dealID


I should probably create domain models rather than using google stuff

Thinking I use venue + deal as PK and SK

SK must be unique


* I need an add deal page with all the information 
* I need to add some deals next to the places
	- Should deals be separate from places. Yes

* Can I hook up graphQL here for the login?

* Decide where I'm going to host everything

* How can I login / register users.
	- Can this work offline (Need to fake offline)
