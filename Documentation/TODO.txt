I need an easy way to delete all deals.
Purely a thing for testing

* Seed categories and start setting them up
* Store the user who created the thing for traceability and attribution

Only allow adding venues for logged in users

Define Auth response types
Do the same for registration
Test with actual responses

Thinking I bring back the user DB
For offline I store all the data there and use that. Won't even do auth
For online I store the user ID and email for later use. 
Offline just uses the email as a token
Should mean the client all works the same

* Passwords need to be validated before creating the user

* Handle errors

* I need to load multiple deals / places based on ID.
	- I think I should just load multiple venues

* Should report be on it's own page.
	- Should I have defaults

- I'm reporting things. Next is to get the list of reports
	- I might end up creating a table with all the places that have open reports

* How does serverless / dynamoDB lock the database?
	- Optimistic locking using .update and a version number

* Some of the deals I've added are garbage I need to remove them.
	- But first they need to be reported
	- Each user can only report once.
	
	
* I should store and display the type of place. (Bar, restaurant)







- I need a central place to store some data like stores in iOS
- Now that I have context I need something to get the location
	- For now the main app can do it, later I'll move it out

What's next
	- I need to find out the location of a user to help with searches
	- UI needs to be much better (Lower priority)
	- I could add some real deals

* Decide where I'm going to host everything

* How can I login / register users.
	- Can this work offline (Need to fake offline)
